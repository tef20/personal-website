Dev tip! 💡

As a developer, I've recently started paying more attention to how words look on the web - typography!

Good typography can make your website pop! Bad typography can be a barrier to your users... Even in a world of amazing audio and visual effects, we still consume a lot of text, but making all these tricky design decisions around text can be exhausting and confusing without a systematic approach!

So here's an awesome and underrated tool that I've found helps me lay the foundations of a tidy, dynamic type system when starting new projects:

⭐ Utopia! ⭐

Utopia is both a powerful tool and a guiding philosophy for approaching sizing and spacing in web design.

It's a simple generator that lets you set:

- a consistent size ratio between types
- the range that each type can expand and contract to

...and gives you back some neat CSS variables that:

- slot seamlessly into your project
- create consistency across your typing scale
- handle responsive sizing gracefully, without jarring breakpoints!

Below is a simple example using heading tags 👇
