Bad typography can be a barrier to your users... Even in a world of amazing audio and visual effects, we still consume a lot of text, but making all these tricky design decisions around text can be exhausting and confusing without a systematic approach!\n\nSo here's an awesome and underrated tool I've found helps me lay the foundations of a good, dynamic type system when starting a new project:\n\n‚≠ê Utopia! ‚≠ê\n\nUtopia is both a powerful tool and a guiding philosophy for approaching sizing and spacing in web design.\n\nIt's a simple generator that lets you set:\n\n- a consistent size ratio between types\n- the range that each type can expand and contract\n\n...and gives you back some neat CSS variables that:\n\n- slot seamlessly into your project\n- create consistency across your typing scale\n- handle responsive sizing gracefully, without jarring breakpoints!\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- Try it for yourself [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/)\n- Read their intro article in [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/designing-developing-fluid-type-space-scales/)\n\nWhat are your favourite tools for designing websites?\n";
